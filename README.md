Playwright demo Rauhl Shetty Academy

This repository is my take on the Rahul Shetty's Academy website and automation practice segment of the same website.

Websites used: https://www.rahulshettyacademy.com/ and https://www.rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/ Playwright version used: 1.36


The project is done in Playwright, with the OOP-like structure. It is consisted of:

1. Selectors that are in a .json file
2. Locators where the selectors are put into variables, located in the services
3. Steps for the logic of each test, also located in the services
4. Tests that are structured for separate functions, located in the tests/RahulShettyAcademyDemo
5. Test data that is located in the test data folder
6. package.json, Playwright config file, tsconfig file that configure the whole project
